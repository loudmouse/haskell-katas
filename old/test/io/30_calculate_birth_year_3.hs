{-
    Introduce the yearToAge pure function to calculate how old someone will be in the year of 2020.
    Bind the result of readMaybe into a variable called "maybeAge"
    Introduce a displayAge function, that handles both Nothing and proper age values:
    * For Nothing: provide the string "You provided an invalid year"
    * For the Year, provide the string "In 2020, you will be: 45" - for example
